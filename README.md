## 1. ðŸ“ˆ What is the volatility trend and what could be causing spikes?

The **line chart** visualizes Appleâ€™s **daily volatility** (calculated as `(High - Low) / Open`) during the month of **August**.

### ðŸ§  Observations:
- Volatility spikes are seen around **August 10th**, **August 17th**, and **August 27th**, each with a value over **0.6**.

### ðŸš¨ Possible Causes:
These spikes likely align with:

## 2. ðŸ”„ Is there a relationship between volume and closing price?

The **scatter plot** compares Appleâ€™s **trading volume** against the **closing stock price**. A **negative correlation** is clearly visible.

### ðŸ“‰ Trend:
- When **volume is low (~0.05B)**, prices often sit **above $100**
- When **volume is high (~0.5B+)**, prices often **fall below $50**

### ðŸ§® Explanation:
This pattern implies that:
- High volume days are often **reactionary**, likely due to:
- Negative news
- Sell-offs by institutional investors
- The trendline suggests an approximate linear relationship:


So, as trading volume increases, Appleâ€™s stock tends to **decrease in price short term**.
